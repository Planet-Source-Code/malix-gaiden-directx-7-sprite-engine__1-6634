## DirectX 7 Sprite Engine


</div>

### Description

The Engine was made as an easy way for making a game with directdraw. It gives you three backgrounds. The background, midground, and foreground. It also has a built in tile engine(if you want to call it that). And allows up to forty sprites which is changeable with the re-writting of a line. More documentation is held within the zip in the rtf file
 
### More Info
 
It is sort of a pain but once you learn it. I think it gets easier to use.

Will probably cause VB to lockup or crash if you don't follow procedures... but then again that's just like directX now isn't it
